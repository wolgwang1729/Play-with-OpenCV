This basic program allows users to open image, convert it to black and white image, show edges of the image (by using Canny method), detect lines(by HoughlinesP method), circles(by Houghcircles method) and human faces(by Haar Cascade method) in the image using OpenCV. The purpose of this program is to allow the users to test the limits of OpenCV and to find its breaking point easily using the tracebar that can change various parameters.This helps beginner learners of OpenCV to get the idea about the effect of each parameter.
